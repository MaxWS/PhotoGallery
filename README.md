Project brief

Title: Photo Gallery

Introduction: This Project consists of a photo gallery. I designed and developed the entire project myself. The user clicks on the image and the selected image is displayed in a larger format at the top of the webpage. It can be used to work within an e-commerce site to see bigger images of a specific product however it can be used in any project when you need to shift through different options, like a Portfolio or Blog.
The entire website UI was done using 'Grid-CSS', 'CSS Flex-box', 'Google Fonts' and 'Font Awesome'. The logic was hardcoded in 'Javascript'.

Technologies: 
* Grid-CSS
* CSS Flex-box
* Font Awesome 
* Google Fonts 
* Javascript
